/*
	Jubal File Read/Write Support

	Currently, there are two kinds of files, songs and patches.
	Songs include Pattern data and ordering, patches for nodes, etc.

	Patches are the parameters of a single audio node, grouped together
	for easy sharing (presets, etc)

	Should there also be file format for saving graphs (the audio routing
	network?)
