ABOUT:

Jubal is a computer music application for Linux written in C and
licensed under the GPLv3.  The Jubal engine will include a variety of
synthesizers and effects combineable through a modular audio routing
system, capable of outputting sound to backends of many platforms
(currently only Linux is supported). The Jubal editing system will
be based on a tracker style UI.  Jubal is still under development,
and is not ready for end-user use... yet!

INSTALL:

To install, navigate to the src dir and run make. To use a
different compiler or compiler options than the default, edit the
Makefile. Eventually this will be replaced by a proper build system,
or at least a more friendly Makefile.

Jubal depends on the following libraries:
    libjack

Jubal is developed by Nate Craun.
